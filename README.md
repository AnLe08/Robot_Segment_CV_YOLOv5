## 🧪 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* Python 3.8+
* PyTorch (>=1.8)
* OpenCV
* Dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`

### Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AnLe08/Robot_Segment_CV_YOLOv5.git
cd Robot_Segment_CV_YOLOv5
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Model Setup

Download or train YOLOv5 segmentation weights (e.g. `yolov5s-seg.pt`) following the Ultralytics segmentation workflow ([GitHub][2], [GitHub][1]).

### Run a Demo

```bash
python examples/demo_robot_segment.py \
  --weights path/to/yolov5s-seg.pt \
  --source path/to/input_stream_or_video \
  --robot-config path/to/robot_connection_config.json
```
